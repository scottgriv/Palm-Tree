## Background Story

I created **Palm Tree** to help small businesses and entrepreneurs keep track of their customers and send out marketing emails. I was inspired to create this application after working with a small business owner who was using a pen and paper to keep track of their customers. With years of experience working with large enterprise CRM applications, I knew there was a better way. I created **Palm Tree** to be a simple, easy to use, and fully interactive CRM application that anyone can use. I hope you enjoy using **Palm Tree** as much as I enjoyed creating it!

## Definitions

- <ins><b>CRM</b></ins>: An acronym for **Customer Relationship Management**. A CRM is a software that helps businesses manage, track, and improve all the relationships with their customers. CRMs centralize all customer data, making it easier for businesses to manage relationships with customers, vendors, and partners. 
- <ins><b>Google Business Review</b></ins>: A review of your business on Google. Google Business Reviews are important because they can give businesses a huge credibility boost without having to spend a dime. The more reviews you have, the more people will trust you and want to do business with you.

## Getting Started

### Download the Application

1. Download **Palm Tree** directly using one of the methods below:
    - Download with **Git**:
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/scottgriv/palm-tree
    ```
    - Download with **Homebrew**:
    ```bash
        brew tap scottgriv/palm-tree https://github.com/scottgriv/Palm-Tree
    ```
    - Download the **Zip File** [Here](https://github.com/scottgriv/Palm-Tree/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. Host the application using your web server and databases. See the **XAMPP** instructions below on how to do this.

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Download **Docker** [Here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Make sure **Docker** is up and running.
    - Make sure you follow the **System Requirements** under your preferred Operating System.
3. Launch your CLI (Command Prompt on Windows/Terminal on Mac).
4. Change the directory using your CLI to your **Palm Tree** directory:
    ```bash
        cd Desktop/Palm-Tree
    ```
5. Once you're in the **Palm Tree** directory, run the ```Docker Compose``` command: 
    ```bash
        docker-compose up
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > This step may take a while to download all of the necessary images.
6. This will build the **Docker Containers** and you should find your application running under *port 80*.
    - Navigate to: ```http://localhost```

### Using XAMPP (Alternative)

1. Download **XAMPP** [Here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
2. Start the `MySQL Database` and `Apache Web Server` services. Optionally, you can install these as a service if you're  using windows so the web server automatically starts and serves **Palm Tree** if the PC ever restarts or shuts down and comes back up:
    > First step to install Apache service, run XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator, then click the Apache service button located on the left side of Apache components, click next and “Click Yes to Install the Apache Service” window will open, then click Yes to continue.
3. Go to the `phpMyAdmin` portal and import the SQL database script `palm_tree.sql` located in the `sql` folder.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The below two steps/changes are to correct the application from the default Docker install above.
4. Update the `sql/config.ini` file changing `db_host = db` to `db_host = localhost`.
5. Update the `container` class menu links in the `container.php` file From/To: 
     - From: `/customers.php` To: `/Palm-Tree/customers.php`
     - From: `/configure.php` To: `/Palm-Tree/configure.php`
     - From: `/email.php` To: `/Palm-Tree/email.php`
- Alternatively, you can update the `httpd.conf` file to set your default index page for your localhost to the `Palm-Tree` directory.
6. Go to your web browser and navigate to the URL: `http://localhost/Palm-Tree` and you should be redirected to the main application page.
7. If you're accessing **Palm Tree** from a mobile device on your local network, you'll have to to access the application using your host machines IP address. To find your IP address, open up your CLI and type:

**Mac**:
```bash
ifconfig
```

- You should see your IP address under the `inet` field, typically listed under `en0` or `en1` for Wi-Fi connections.

**Windows**:
```bash
ipconfig
```
- You should see your IP address under the `IPv4 Address` field under the appropriate network adapter. <br><br>
- Update the `sql/config.ini` file changing `db_host_ip = localhost` to `db_host = <your_ip_address>`.
- Navigate to the URL: `http://<your_ip_address>/Palm-Tree` and you should be redirected to the main application page.
